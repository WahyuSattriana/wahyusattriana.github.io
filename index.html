                            The first design software I used was CorelDraw X4. When I finished 
                            making something there, I felt so satisfied with it. Then my brother introduced me to 
                            another editing software named Adobe Photoshop. I was so confused by the tools 
                            that Photoshop has. And yes, CorelDraw and Photoshop have different usability. 
                            I tried editing some photos in Photoshop while watching several tutorials, but 
                            I still preferred designing in CorelDraw. From there, Adobe Illustrator appeared 
                            in front of my face. My desire to design is back. So I kept learning  design 
                            graphics, even until I was in middle school. I learned
                            some design basics, such as color and font combinations, layouts, and others. In 
                            middle school, I pushed myself to brand my name as a designer to my friends, and 
                            because of it, I succeed in making a bit of a penny even my teacher trusted me to 
                            handle my school's Instagram. Click the button below to see my artworks.

                            I love spending my time watching YouTube in 2016. That was the golden era of Indonesia's
                            YouTube content. I've seen many YouTubers adding cinematic clips to their content.
                            So from that, I'm willing to do it by myself. I started recording anything I like.
                            Recording myself gaming <i>(uhh cringe)</i>, editing tutorials, and my favorite, making cinematic
                            videos. Many people see me like what the hell am I doing with my camera phone. But 
                            unfortunately, I was just a 5th-grade kid so I don't care. Filmmaking has a ton of aspects to 
                            learn like color grading, sound design, storytelling, and a bunch of technical
                            stuff. In high school me with friends joining a small online video contest and rewarded the top 10
                            by the judge's choice. I usually do not post my film on social media, but you can see my photo
                            gallery with cinematic style

                            But now, I focused on programming. The first time I dived into programming is when I was in 7th grade middle school.
                            I learned the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Unfortunately, I was all alone. I got nobody to talk about
                            programming so I ended up cutting off my learning journey. Now in high school, I got some friends that have programming
                            hobbies. On the other sides, I already got UI/UX design skills before so I am enjoying working on CSS study cases.
                            The picture beside or below is my skill index of UI/UX design, Frontend, and Backend Developers. It's my life journey, stay
                            tuned and see what I got next :).
